Live Power BI Dashboard

🚀 Power BI Dashboard: Real-Time Weather & Air Quality Analysis ☁️⚠️

Excited to share my latest Power BI project focused on visualizing live, real-time data streams! 📊 This dashboard compares critical weather and environmental metrics for major Indian cities, pulling data directly from a public API. 🔗

🔍 Key Insights from the Live Dashboard (Focus: New Delhi and Ahmedabad)
📆Nov 22, 2025
Current Temperature: 🌡️ New Delhi (24 C) and Ahmedabad (27 C).
Air Quality Index (AQI): The critical difference between the two cities is immediately apparent.
New Delhi: AQI 231 (🔴 Hazardous), driven by high PM2.5 and PM10 levels.
Ahmedabad: AQI 62 (🟢 Moderate).
Trend Analysis: The dashboard displays a 5-day temperature forecast, showing a slight cooling trend for both locations. 📉

🛠️ Skills & Tools Used:
Power BI: Data Modeling, DAX, and Visualization (Focus on Dark Mode Design). 🖥️
API Integration: Successfully connecting Power BI to a live web data source for continuous data refresh. 🌐
Real-Time Data Handling: Techniques for processing and visualizing constantly changing metrics. ⏱️
Environmental Data Analysis: Visualizing key pollutant concentrations (PM10, PM2.5, NO2, CO, SO2, O3). 🔬

🎯 Objective: To demonstrate the capability of Power BI to handle live data feeds and to create an instantly informative dashboard that color-codes risk (Hazardous versus Moderate) for critical public health data. 💡
